# Instrumenting Java applications with EDOT SDKs on Kubernetes

Learn how to instrument Java applications on Kubernetes using the OpenTelemetry Operator, the {{edot}} (EDOT) Collectors, and the EDOT Java SDK.

- For general knowledge about the EDOT Java SDK, refer to the [EDOT Java Intro page](/reference/edot-java/index.md).
- For Java auto-instrumentation specifics, refer to [OpenTelemetry Operator Java auto-instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#java).
- For general information about instrumenting applications on Kubernetes, refer to [instrumenting applications on Kubernetes](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/instrumenting-applications.md).

## Extensions consideration

The operator supports a configuration that installs [Java agent extensions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/extensions/) in `Instrumentation` objects. The extension needs to be available in an image. Refer to [using extensions with the OpenTelemetry Java agent](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/using-the-otel-operator-for-injecting-elastic-agents#using-an-extension-with-the-opentelemetry-java-agent) for an example of adding an extension to an agent.

## Instrument a Java app

Following this example, you can learn how to:

- Turn on auto-instrumentation of a Java application using one of the following supported methods:
  - Adding an annotation to the deployment Pods.
  - Adding an annotation to the namespace.
- Verify that auto-instrumentation libraries are injected and configured correctly.
- Confirm data is flowing to {{kib}} Observability.

In this example, the application you're instrumenting is a deployment named `java-app` running in the `java-ns` namespace.

1. Ensure you have successfully [installed the OpenTelemetry Operator](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/deployment.md) and confirm that the following `Instrumentation` object exists in the system:

    ```sh
    $ kubectl get instrumentation -n opentelemetry-operator-system
    NAME                      AGE    ENDPOINT
    elastic-instrumentation   107s   http://opentelemetry-kube-stack-daemon-collector.opentelemetry-operator-system.svc.cluster.local:4318
    ```

   :::{note}
   If your `Instrumentation` object has a different name or is created in a different namespace, you will have to adapt the annotation value in the next step.
   :::

2. Turn on auto-instrumentation of your Java application using one of the following methods:

    - Edit your application workload definition and include the annotation under `spec.template.metadata.annotations`:

        ```yaml
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        name: java-app
        namespace: java-ns
        spec:
        # ...
        template:
            metadata:
        # ...
            annotations:
                instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: opentelemetry-operator-system/elastic-instrumentation
        # ...
        ```

    - Alternatively, add the annotation at namespace level to apply auto-instrumentation in all Pods of the namespace:

        ```sh
        kubectl annotate namespace java-ns instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java=opentelemetry-operator-system/elastic-instrumentation
        ```

3. Restart the application

    After the annotation has been set, restart the application to create new Pods and inject the instrumentation libraries:

    ```sh
    kubectl rollout restart deployment java-app -n java-ns
    ```

4. Verify the [auto-instrumentation resources](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/instrumenting-applications.md#how-auto-instrumentation-works) are injected in the Pod:

    Run a `kubectl describe` of one of your application Pods and check:

    - There should be an init container named `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java` in the Pod:

        ```sh
        $ kubectl describe pod java-app-8d84c47b8-8h5z2 -n java-ns
        Name:             java-app-8d84c47b8-8h5z2
        Namespace:        java-ns
        ...
        ...
        Init Containers:
        opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java:
            Container ID:  containerd://...
            Image:         docker.elastic.co/observability/elastic-otel-javaagent:...
            Image ID:      docker.elastic.co/observability/elastic-otel-javaagent@sha256:...
            Port:          <none>
            Host Port:     <none>
            Command:
            cp
            /javaagent.jar
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-java/javaagent.jar
            State:          Terminated
            Reason:       Completed
            Exit Code:    0
            Started:      Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:47:02 +0100
            Finished:     Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:47:03 +0100
            Ready:          True
            Restart Count:  0
            Environment:    <none>
            Mounts:
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-java from opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java (rw)
            /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-swhn5 (ro)
        ```

    - The main container of the deployment is using the SDK as `javaagent`:

        ```bash
        ...
        Containers:
        java-app:
            Environment:
        ...
            JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS:                      -javaagent:/otel-auto-instrumentation-java/javaagent.jar
            OTEL_SERVICE_NAME:                     java-app
            OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT:           http://opentelemetry-kube-stack-daemon-collector.opentelemetry-operator-system.svc.cluster.local:4318
        ...
        ```

    - The Pod has an `EmptyDir` volume named `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java` mounted in both the main and the init containers in path `/otel-auto-instrumentation-java`.

        ```bash
        Init Containers:
        opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java:
        ...
            Mounts:
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-java from opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java (rw)
        Containers:
        java-app:
        ...
            Mounts:
            /otel-auto-instrumentation-java from opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java (rw)
        ...
        Volumes:
        ...
        opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java:
            Type:        EmptyDir (a temporary directory that shares a pod's lifetime)
        ```

    Ensure the environment variable `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` points to a valid endpoint and there's network communication between the Pod and the endpoint.

5. Confirm data is flowing to {{kib}}:

    - Open **Observability** → **Applications** → **Service inventory**, and determine if:
        - The application appears in the list of services.
        - The application shows transactions and metrics.

    - For application container logs, open {{kib}} Discover and filter for your Pods' logs. In the provided example, we could filter for them with either of the following:
        - `k8s.deployment.name: "java-app"` (adapt the query filter to your use case)
        - `k8s.pod.name: java-app*` (adapt the query filter to your use case)

    Note that the container logs are not provided by the instrumentation library, but by the DaemonSet collector deployed as part of the [operator installation](docs-content://solutions/observability/get-started/opentelemetry/use-cases/kubernetes/deployment.md).
