# Baggage examples

This is an elementary application providing an end-to-end example usage of [OpenTelemetry baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/baggage/).

It is split in two services: a gateway and a backend
- an HTTP backend service running on http://localhost:9000/backend/
- an HTTP gateway service running on http://localhost:8000/gateway/

The gateway is in charge of authentication and delegates to the backend by providing a technical ID for the backend to use for authentication.

## Build

```bash
./gradlew clean assemble
```

## Configure

The javaagent is already packaged and included in the application by using [runtime attach](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/opentelemetry/edot-sdks/java/setup/runtime-attach) feature.

OTel configuration must be provided through environment variables or JVM system properties.

## Run

Backend:
```shell
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME='backend'
java \
-Dotel.java.experimental.span-attributes.copy-from-baggage.include=example.customer.id,example.customer.name \
-Dotel.java.experimental.log-attributes.copy-from-baggage.include=example.customer.id,example.customer.name \
-jar ./build/libs/baggage-example-all.jar backend
```

Gateway:
```shell
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME='gateway'
java \
-Dotel.java.experimental.span-attributes.copy-from-baggage.include=example.customer.id,example.customer.name \
-Dotel.java.experimental.log-attributes.copy-from-baggage.include=example.customer.id,example.customer.name \
-jar ./build/libs/baggage-example-all.jar gateway
```

Once both services are started, you can execute queries on the gateway with queries like the following:
```shell
curl -H 'Authorization: secret=12345' http://localhost:8000/gateway/
```

This will create the following log messages on `gateway` and `backend` respectively:
```
gateway request for customer ID = 12345
backend request for customer ID = 12345
```

All the spans and logs captured within the scope of the baggage will have the following attributes:
- `example.customer.name` with value `my-awesome-customer-12345`
- `example.customer.id` with value `12345`

As a result, it is now possible to use those custom attributes to filter data and create
dedicated dashboards. The only code modification required is in the gateway code.
